import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Why Pawnote ?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Fully typed" icon="rocket">
    Each request payload and response is fully typed in the library, making both your and our code more reliable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Support for 2023 version" icon="approve-check">
    Pawnote supports the latest version of PRONOTE, and should also support version 2022 and earlier
    but some properties can be wrong or `undefined`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adapted for every usage" icon="star">
    You can customize the fetcher used within the library to use whatever HTTP API you need.
    By default, it uses `fetch` API so Node.js, React Native and more are supported out of the box !
  </Card>
  <Card title="Same flow as the UI" icon="puzzle">
    Pawnote tries to have the same flow as the official UI, so that it can provide full context depending on what is requested.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
