## `api`

The `api` folder contains the core of Pawnote, it's the part that contains the types and the functions to interact with the Pronote API.

In there, we have a folder for each requests. Each folder contains two files :

- `index.ts` : the handler
- `types.ts` : the types

You can also nest folders, example : `api/login/informations/types.ts`

## `constants`

As the name suggests, here we'll only have constants for `api`. Mostly to to avoid magic numbers and strings.

Enumerations, interfaces and types for the Pronote API can be added here.

## `pronote`

The naming is a bit misleading, but this folder contains the code to parse and/or generate stuff from/for Pronote.

Some of their internals are in there, it's like a `utils` but specific to Pronote.

You can find the function to read a date from their API here, for example.

## `utils`

Global utilities, outside of the Pronote scope.

You can find the logic for the `fetcher` here, but also the one for `haversine` and more.

## `errors`

Custom errors for Pawnote, to give a better developer experience.

Allows for better error handling by `catch`ing a specific error using `instanceof`.

## `parser`

Transforms responses of the Pronote API into something more readable and usable, for a globally better developer experience.

## `client`

First-layer of Pawnote, it's the part that will be used by the developers.
It uses the `api` to call the Pronote API, and the `parser` to parse the responses.

If anything goes wrong, it'll give an error depending on the ones defined in the `errors` folder.
